        <h3>What is Neapolitan Pizza?</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Neapolitan pizza</strong> is pizza made in the style that originated in Naples, Italy. Like any famous dish, there many variations 
            on what it means to be “authentic.” Most Neapolitan pizzas are baked in a wood fired pizza oven that’s around 800 to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
            The crust is typically blackened by the fire, with puffed edges and very thin towards the middle.
