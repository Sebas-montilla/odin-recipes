        <h3>What is Bruschetta?</h3>
        <p>It's just a mixture of chopped tomatoes, balsamic, basil, and garlic, spooned over olive-oil brushed slices of toasted baguette or rustic bread. 
            It's perfect for a party because you can make a large batch of the topping ahead of time, as well as toasting baguette slices.</p>

                Toast bread until golden, 10 to 15 minutes, turning halfway through. 
                Let bread cool for 5 minutes, then rub tops of bread with halved garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>Spoon tomatoes on top of bread just before serving.</li>
